# Stiff Drink #
Stiff Drink is a responsive HTML5 Drupal theme centered around the lightweight SASS mixin library [bourbon](http://bourbon.io). 

## Features ##
Stiff Drink is not technically a starter theme but can probably be used as one like any other Drupal theme. It is very bare bones, but does contain a few things out of the box:
* [Neat grid system](http://neat.bourbon.io)
* [Bitters default styling and scaffolding](http://bitters.bourbon.io)

## Dependencies ##
The theme needs the wonderful [blockify](https://www.drupal.org/project/blockify) module to operate properly, without it you would need to manually add things back into the template files like logo, page title, etc.

## Future ##
* Add grunt support for things like image optimization, SASSyness, and browser reloading
* Add some settings for turning on browser reloading, IE classes, etc
* Some other stuff
